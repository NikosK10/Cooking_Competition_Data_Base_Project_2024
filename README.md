In this project, we created a database in MySQL. The project is about a cooking competition. Obviously, the database contains ingredients, recipes from many cuisines,cooks,judges and their features. Lastly, we created a lottery for the episodes, the recipes, the cooks, the judges of each episode and a random score for the cooks of the episode and the winners as well. We were asked not to allow the participation of the same cook,recipe,judge for up to three consecutive episodes. We highlight that we needed a big number of dummy data (for example over 50 cooks,over 50 recipes over 100 ingredients etc) so we got these data with the help of Chatgpt. For the purpose of the given queries we carried on the competition for 2 years (with the same recipes and cooks obviously.) We uploaded the DDL,DML as well the Queries file in which you can find indexes in order to make the queries more efficient too.

This project was created as part of the course "Data Bases" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my personal research but as my approach to the problems given. Please read the project's prompt (provided in Greek) for detailed descriptions of the tasks.

Special thanks to my fellow student, Georgios Tzamouranis (https://github.com/giorgostzamouranis) , with whom I collaborated for the implementation of this project.
